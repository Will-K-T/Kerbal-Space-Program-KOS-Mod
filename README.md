# Kerbal Space Program KOS Mod

This is my code for the automation of rockets in Kerbal Space Program using the KOS mod. The KOS mod uses a language called KerbalScript to interface with the parts in Kerbal Space Program. I started this project to learn about the math and physics that goes into getting a rocket to orbit, transferring orbits, and landing on other celestial bodies. All of my code uses the actual equations from orbital mechanics!
